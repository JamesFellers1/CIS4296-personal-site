    <h2> Database Specifications</h2>

    <p>
        This page was from a previous class to show the progression as the class progressed. <br />
        The table will be focused on data pertaining to pollution and which types are at risk of killing marine wildlife. The fields will be the
        primary key, the name of the pollution item, the image url, the percentage of recorded deaths from the material, the commonality or the
        presence of this pollutant, and the lethality of the pollutant. <br />

    <h2>My Web Development Experience</h2>
    <p>
        The experience I have with web development is very minimal. I have designed some very bare-bones websites and done some work with Web APIs,
        but I am still very new to it all.
    </p>
    <h2>Homepage Homework</h2>
    <p>
        When doing the Homepage Homework, the main trouble I had was getting the design to be responsive. Getting the nav bar to go where it
        was supposed to was the hardest part because I could not get the links to line up correctly. Eventually I was able to figure it out.
        Otherwise, it was smooth sailing with the help of the sample code.
    </p>

    <h2>JS UI Homework</h2>
    <p>
        The JS UI Homework was a bit more challenging as it included some more advanced code to look through and understand. Personally, I had
        trouble with blending the files together because I had been injecting my title div into the content, and it was covering my nav bar. I
        took a while to get this issue fixed, but once I did, I was able to get the rest done rather easily.
    </p>
    <h2>JS Object HW</h2>
    <p>
        This homework was not as challenging as I thought it would be. I was able to use what I learned from the Lab Activity and apply that
        to this. The only thing that gave me trouble really was getting the .css to match up and look ok. The elements resizing and being
        responsive made the style designing harder than I thought it would be. I had some trouble with getting the coloring of the links to be
        what I wanted them too, but otherwise it was ok!
    </p>

    <h2>JS Object List HW</h2>
    <p>
        This homework was rather easy for me. I was able to use the code from the Lab Activity to guide me along how to do this. Surprisingly,
        everything seemed to work as soon as I edited each of the variables to match up with my website. Since all the css work was already
        done in the last lab, all I had to really do was edit each of the .css selectors to the content on my page and use that to style my
        elements that were unique to my website.
    </p>
    <h2>AJAX Slide Show HW</h2>
    <p>
        I learned a lot during this homework. By not having to edit or mess with too much of the AJAX code, it took a lot of the stress out of
        what I thought I was going to have to do. Instead of messing with all the components of getting AJAX to work, I was able to observe
        it from a distance and see how it worked from the client side. I remember having a lot of trouble trying to understand how to code AJAX,
        but now I can watch how it works through the comments in the console and figure it out that way. It is much easier than trying to code it
        myself and running into an error every line of code that I write.
    </p>
    <h2>Click Sort HW</h2>
    <p>
        This homework was certainly the most challenging to figure out by far. There was so much to understand when it came to an HTML table alone
        that it felt a bit overwhelming trying to learn what component did what. Between the rows, columns, and table data elements, it made my head
        spin trying to read it all and understand it. The reverse sort and filter components were easier because of the lab activities, however
        implementing them brought with it some unforeseen challenges.
    </p>
    <h2>Insert Edit List HW</h2>
    <p>
        I had a hard time with this homework as is to be expected from the final assignment of the semester. It was tough to figure out how to get the
        input to work correctly and get all the attributes to line up. I had a particularly hard time with the radio button and getting the values to
        show up correctly. I could not get the options I wanted to show up for the radio button, unfortunately. It was definitely one of the toughest assignments
        thus far.
